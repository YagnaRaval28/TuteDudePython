<h1>Task-1</h1>
<h2>Odd or Even Number Checker</h2>

This is a simple Python program that checks whether a given number is odd or even.

How It Works

The user is prompted to enter a number.

The program checks if the number is divisible by 2.

If it is, the number is even.

Otherwise, it is odd.

The result is printed on the screen.


<h2>Sum of Numbers from 1 to 50</h2>

This is a simple Python program that calculates and displays the sum of all numbers from 1 to 50 using a for loop.

How It Works

A variable sum is initialized to 0.

A for loop iterates through numbers from 1 to 49 (since range(1,50) excludes 50).

Each number is added to the sum.

Finally, the program prints the total sum.
